## Tiktok Downloader - Download Videos Offline: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Tiktok Downloader - Download Videos Offline app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Gadget 6 (Hashir ali as solo developer).

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how frustrating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

### Data collected by the app

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. 

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` (API level >= 33) and `android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` | An optional permission. Has to be granted by the user manually; can be revoked by the system or the user at any time. This is required to play videos from within the app and download videos on device. `READ_MEDIA_VIDEO` is a granular permission introduced in API level 33, and is, therefore, requested in Android 13 and higher. For lower Android versions upto Android 12, the app requests `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`. |
| `android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS` | Required by the app to post notifications. Has to be granted by the user manually; can be revoked by the system or the user at any time. It is highly recommended that you allow this permission so that the app can see download progress of the videos. |

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email or post a discussion on GitHub, and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,  
Hashir.
